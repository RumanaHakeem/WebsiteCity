            <div class='about'>
                <p id="abt_windsor">Prior to European exploration and settlement, the Windsor area was inhabited by the First Nations and Native Americans. A French agricultural settlement was established at the site of Windsor in 1749. It is the oldest continually inhabited European-founded settlement in Canada west of Montreal. The area was first named la Petite Côte ("Little Coast" – as opposed to the longer coastline on the Detroit side of the river). Later it was called La Côte de Misère ("Poverty Coast") because of the sandy soils near LaSalle.\
                    <br/><br/>Windsor's French-Canadian heritage is reflected in French street names such as Ouellette, Pelissier, François, Pierre, Langlois, Marentette, and Lauzon. The current street system of Windsor (a grid with elongated blocks) reflects the Canadien method of agricultural land division, where the farms were long and narrow, fronting along the river. Today, the north–south street name often indicates the name of the family that at one time farmed the land where the street is now located. The street system of outlying areas is consistent with the British system for granting land concessions. There is a significant French-speaking minority in Windsor and the surrounding area, particularly in the Lakeshore, Tecumseh and LaSalle areas.
                    <br/><br/>In 1794, after the American Revolution, the settlement of "Sandwich" was founded. It was later renamed Windsor, after the town in Berkshire, England. The Sandwich neighbourhood on Windsor's west side is home to some of the oldest buildings in the city, including Mackenzie Hall, originally built as the Essex County Courthouse in 1855. Today, this building functions as a community centre. The oldest building in the city is the Duff-Baby House built in 1792. It is owned by Ontario Heritage Trust and houses government offices. The François Baby House in downtown Windsor was built in 1812 and houses Windsor's Community Museum, dedicated to local history.
                    <br/><br/>Windsor has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification Dfa) with four distinct seasons.[11][12] The mean annual temperature is 9.9 °C (50 °F), among the warmest in Canada primarily due to its hot summers. Some locations in coastal and lower mainland British Columbia have a slightly higher mean annual temperature due to milder winter conditions there. The coldest month is January and the warmest month is July. The coldest temperature ever recorded in Windsor was −32.8 °C (−27.0 °F) on January 29, 1873[13] and the warmest was 40.2 °C (104.4 °F) on June 25, 1988.
                    <br/><br/>Summers are hot and humid,[12] with a July mean temperature of 23.0 °C (73 °F) although the humidex reaches 30.0 °C (86.0 °F) or above 70 times in an average summer.[15] Thunderstorms are common during summer and occur on average 32 days per year.[12][15] Winters are generally mild with occasional cold periods.[12] The mean temperature in January is −3 °C (27 °F).[15] Windsor is not located in the traditional lake-effect snowbelts but does occasionally see lake-effect snow that originates over Lake Michigan. Snow cover is intermittent throughout the winter; on average there are 53 days each year with snow on the ground. There are typically three to five major snowfalls each winter. Windsor has the highest number of days per year with lightning, haze, and daily maximum temperatures over 30 °C (86 °F) of cities in Canada.[16] Windsor is also home to eastern Canada's warmest fall, with the highest mean temperatures for the months of September, October and November.[16] Precipitation is generally well-distributed throughout the year. There are on average 2,261 sunshine hours per year in Windsor.
